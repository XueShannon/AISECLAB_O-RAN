# Weekly Task
**Description:** This file will be updated every week. Please scratch the complete task.

## Week 1 [02/02/2024-02/09/2024]
1. What is O-RAN? How it works?
   - ~~Complete the reading of [Understanding O-RAN: Architecture, Interfaces, Algorithms, Security, and Research Challenges](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01032.pdf)~~
   - ~~Network Architecture, and how each Unit works together? How does each Unit transmit data?~~
   - ~~For Federated Learning (FL), where is the data from? what kind of data can be extracted?~~
   - ~~How does the FL process map to the network architecture?~~
  
2. Join our POWDER Project 'CPE900'
   - ~~Here's the link to guide you to join an existing project, and our project ID is 'CPE900'. Please follow section 5.1.1 to join. https://docs.powderwireless.net/users.html~~
   - ~~Some guidance and examples talk about software/hardware suggestions, you can go through them first and have a sense of what language, platform we need to use to complete the project.~~


## Week 2 [02/10/2024-02/16/2024]
1. Intitated an experiment with NFS-Dataset Profile **[Did not build the enviroment successfully]**
   - Establishing Contacts in nodes.
   - Creating a Temp Dataset to test on.
   - Working on Scripts to create and send Data/Model between Central Node(Server) and others.

## Week 3 [02/17/2024-02/23/2024]
1. Parkar follows Powder's instruction to establish the connection
   - Powder Website provides steps to use O-RAN profile, please follow it to complete. [Demos Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMg_F_VJ4G0&list=PLtBMr52yxl464brQQyz8J5hK4SYQd7eGH)
      - Experiment Resources appended to [POWDER\README.md](POWDER\README.md)
   - If need to submit any request for the hardware access, please contact Xiaochan first and then submit the application.
   - Upload and record each step that you build [here](https://github.com/XueShannon/AISECLAB_O-RAN/tree/main/POWDER)
  
## Week 5 [03/01/2024-03/08/2024]
1. Collect CSI;
2. Store CSI;
3. Write xApp for machine learning, including some subtasks:
   1) where and how to retrieve data,
   2) train the model,
   3) store and deploy the trained model.
4. Subscription ---
